> Front-end interface for SIMON

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

`SIMON` is a powerful, flexible, open-source and easy to use knowledge discovery application.

Currently `SIMON` implements automated machine learning and statistical data discovery features
that will help you to easily illustrate dynamic relationships and provide you with a structural sense of your data.

Goal of this project is to make unified user interface that will empower anyone to extract meaningful information from their data and enable them to rapidly use machine learning algorithms. `It gives you freedom and control over your own data.`

While `SIMON` can be used in across many different fields, 
our focus here is scientific community so we can enable scientist and other researchers in the field to quickly prototype around their data and get meaningful results out of it.

## Why is this so awesome?
* :file_folder: **Feature learning** You can discover relevant trends and patterns with ease, that would usually take years of manual handcrafting.
* :package: **Visualize & analyze** Exploratory analysis will give you instant insights with help of many different algorithms.
* :arrows_counterclockwise: **Share your Data** You share your results with others
* :cloud: **All Benefits of the Cloud** ...on your own Server, in your own control.
* :lock: **Encryption** You can encrypt data in transit with secure https connections.
* :lock: **Privacy** Since data is hosted on your own servers you don't have to worry about someone else is looking after your data
